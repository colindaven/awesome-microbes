## Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak Resources 

### International Government Organization

[US Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html) - Situation Summary - "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Chinese authorities identified the new coronavirus, which has resulted in thousands of confirmed cases in China, including cases outside Wuhan City. Additional cases have been identified in a growing number of other international locations, including the United States. There are ongoing investigations to learn more."

[CDC - Testing for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html) - “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is intended for use with the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast DX Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS 1.4 software.  CDC is shipping the test kits to laboratories CDC has designated as qualified, including U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense (DOD) laboratories and select international laboratories. The test kits are bolstering global laboratory capacity for detecting SARS-CoV-2.  

[World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) - "This page is a one-stop shop for all information and guidance from WHO regarding the current outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. Please visit this page for daily updates. WHO is working closely with global experts, governments and partners to rapidly expand scientific knowledge on this new virus, to track the spread and virulence of the virus, and to provide advice to countries and individuals on measures to protect health and prevent the spread of this outbreak." [Situation Reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)

[US National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus) - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Summary.  

[US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/niaid-officials-discuss-novel-coronavirus-recently-emerged-china) - "Current studies at NIAID-funded institutions and by scientists in NIAID laboratories include efforts that build on previous work on SARS- and MERS-CoVs. For example, researchers are developing diagnostic tests to rapidly detect 2019-nCoV infection and exploring the use of broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat 2019-nCoVs, the authors note. NIAID researchers also are adapting approaches used with investigational SARS and MERS vaccines to jumpstart candidate vaccine development for 2019-nCoV. Advances in technology since the SARS outbreak have greatly compressed the vaccine development timeline, the authors write. They indicate that a candidate vaccine for 2019-nCoV could be ready for early-stage human testing in as little as three months as compared to 20 months for early-stage development of an investigational SARS vaccine."

[US Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov) - "FDA is working with U.S. Government partners, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and international partners to closely monitor an outbreak caused by a novel (new) coronavirus first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China."

The structure models are generated by the C-I-TASSER pipeline, which utilizes deep convolutional network based contact-map predictions to guide the I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Benchark and blind CASP tests showed that C-I-TASSER generates models with a higher accuracy than I-TASSER does, especially for the protein targets lack of homologous templates."

### Testing
[CDC Guideline on Testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/testing-laboratories.html)
CDC provides the test kits for public health laboratories (PHLs) to perform real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) in respiratory specimens. These test kits are available through the [International Reagent Resource (IRR)](https://www.internationalreagentresource.org/About/IRR.aspx).  

Currently, genomic RNA material can be used for validation purposes at biosafety level 2 laboratories (BSL-2). Genomic RNA material is available through [BEI Resources.](https://www.beiresources.org/Home.aspx) BEI Resources was established by NIAID/NIH to provide reagents, tools and information for studying Category A, B, and C priority #pathogens and other microbes.
